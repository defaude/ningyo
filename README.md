1. Install dependencies: `npm install` (just once, don't worry)
2. Add Markdown files containing one (or more) `mermaid` code blocks. See
   [the reference](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/n00b-syntaxReference.html) for finding out what you can do with Mermaid.
3. Run `npm run build` to generate the SVG files in [./output]().

Sadly, there are no network / cloud diagrams available at the moment, but with a little effort, it _might_ become
reality [some time in the future](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/1227).

By the way: The generated SVG images will be optimized with [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo) ✌️
